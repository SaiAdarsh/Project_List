# Project_List

Hello and Welcome!
This is the landing page for my Github Repository. I'm a Computer Science postgraduate from the University of Waterloo. Owing to the proprietary nature of the source code for a lot of my school (research) projects, GitHub is where I host my personal projects. Herein, I try to replicate my school projects using open-source technolgies and bring my other ideas to life by tinkering with new frameworks and tools.

I have included brief introductions as well as links to the GitHub repositories of all my projects. Feel free to navigate and leave feedback/questions via pull requests.
